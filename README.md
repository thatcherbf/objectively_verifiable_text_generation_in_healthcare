# Objectively Verifiable Text Generation For Predicting and Preventing Disease

### Final year project at Imperial College London

There is a great deal of interest in developing large language models (LLMs) for use in healthcare. However, LLMs are vulnerable to generating false, inaccurate, or misleading information that can cause harm, particularly in information-critical domains like healthcare. Therefore, it is very unlikely that LLMs will be widely used in healthcare until this problem can be solved. The objective of this project was to create and objectively test the performance of an LLM that can generate verifiable responses to questions about predicting and preventing disease.
